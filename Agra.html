                <p class="center">The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, which
                     includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>

                <p class="center">
                    Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest 
                    of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.</p>

                <p class="center">
                    Fatehpur Sikri is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India. The city itself was founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, serving this role from
                     1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was later completely abandoned in 1610..</p>
