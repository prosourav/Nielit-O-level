                    Golconda Fort also known as Golkonda, is a fortified citadel and an early capital city of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds, known as the Golconda Diamonds. The region has produced some of the world's most famous diamonds, including the colourless Koh-i-Noor, the blue Hope, the pink Daria-i-Noor, the white Regent, the Dresden Green, and 
                    the colourless Orlov, Nizam and Jacob, as well as the now lost diamonds Florentine Yellow, Akbar Shah and Great Mogul.</p>
