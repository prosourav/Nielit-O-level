                <p class="center">We were not sure what to expect from this tour, but were pleasantly surprised.
                     The hotels and homestay were lovely and clean. The staff made our trip most enjoyable and nothing was too much trouble.The food was presented in a way that you felt like you were at a five star restaurant. We had the most enjoyable sleep ever. I would definitely do this trip again.

                     When we arrive at airport, the guide and driver were waited us there. Our tour was wonderful with wonderful foods and great hotels. We had a great tour of Tajmahal on the Delhi. Lovely ship, great guides, and amazing food and accomodations. We will use this company again!</p>
